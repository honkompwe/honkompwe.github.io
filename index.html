<!--------refinements---------- 
1) add thinkful experience in-progress
2) can I consolidate the work experience pictures into shorter code on CSS? (specificity?)
3) 
4)  add more about music producer in resume?
5)  remove whitespace between images (font-size: 0; trick?? remove mysterious default margin?)
6)  different name font
7) block.content placement could probably be done better.
8) make links change with :hover
9) contact info should be interactive,  (mobile: click on ph.# and it comes up to call)
10) a11y
